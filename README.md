# utility

Utility functions to facilitate day-to-day jobs on the command line. 
All functions follow the following pseudocode:

```Action [Object] [Target]```

<ins>Action</ins> is any programmatic verb that defined actions to be executed, 
such as *get*, *peek* or *replace*. 

<ins>Object</ins>  is any IT object like *file*, *memory* or *connection*.

<ins>Target</ins>  can be any destination, direction or number like *file* where 
the pattern is searched, *direction* (back/forth) when applying replacement or 
output *length* when rendering the desired output.
