# utility

Those are utility functions to facilitate day-to-day jobs on the command line. 
All functions follow the following format:

```Action [Target] [Quantity] [Quality] [Destination]```

<ins>Action</ins> is any verb that defined actions to be executed, 
such as *get*, *peek* or *replace*. 

<ins>Target</ins>  can be any IT object like *file*, *memory* or *connection*.

<ins>Quantity</ins> can be any quantifiable output like *5*.

<ins>Quality</ins> can show, for example, *direction* (back/forth) when applying replacement.  

<ins>Destination</ins> can be any destination (such as a *file*) where 
the pattern is searched.
